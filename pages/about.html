                <p>Growing up in the Devon countryside, I was always surrounded by nature. This connection to the outdoors grew my love for the natural world. Everything from plants and animals, to the sky, sea, earth, and even space. I was especially lucky to have little light pollution allowing for a very pristine view of the night sky. That was until our neighbour across the valley decided to set up a night light on their cow barn which has the brightness of a collapsed star…</p>
                <br>
                <p>Currently, I’m based in North Wales on a placement with the Wildlife Trust. I was a physics student at Durham University, but dropped out after two years and am aiming for a career in the wildlife and conservation sector.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’ve been into photography for as long as I remember and have always loved the way a single photo can convey meaning and emotions. I always try to educate people with my photos so they learn something as well. Learning more about what I photograph is important for me as I feel that knowing more about the subject gives more meaning and depth to the image, as well as expanding my knowledge on the natural world.</p>
                <h2>My Equipment</h2>
                <p>The camera I currently use is the Canon 80D with the three lenses:</p>
                <p>- EF 50mm f/1.8 STM</p>
                <p>- EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 USM</p>
                <p>- EF S10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some of the older photos were taken with the Canon 100D and EF 18-55mm f/4.5-5.6 STM but I rarely use these anymore.</p>
                <p>Aerial photos and videos are taken with the DJI Mavic 2 Pro.</p>
                <p>For the astrophotography and astronomy, I have the Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer Star Tracker for wider angle photos. For much more zoomed, I have the Meade 8" LX90 ACF telescope.</p>
